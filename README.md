# AI Drive Assistant

## Problem Definition

- Research indicates that a significant portion of traffic accidents, surpassing 50 percent, can be attributed to drivers' failure to adhere to safe driving practices. These practices include neglecting forward observation, engaging in reckless driving behaviors, using mobile devices while driving, and operating vehicles while fatigued. In response to this issue, our team has devised a service aimed at establishing an environment conducive to driver focus by actively monitoring driving conditions. The introduction of an artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to function as a standalone assistant during solitary driving scenarios holds great potential. This AI model is expected to effectively handle unforeseen circumstances and ensure a driver's emotional well-being and concentration remain consistently at a suitable level for safe driving.

- The application employs monitoring techniques to assess the user's condition and subsequently offers tailored services categorized as normal, drowsy driving, mobile phone manipulation, driver aggression, drunk driving, and object detection. The specific services provided based on the monitoring status are presented in the following table:

|Monitoring Status|Services|
|:--:|:--:|



- The application's ability to classify the user's condition and offer appropriate services contributes to enhancing driver safety and reducing the occurrence of accidents associated with various risky driving behaviors.
